# Animations

---

## `useValue()`

```tsx
const useValue: <V extends string | number | boolean>(value: V, deps: Dependencies) => Animated.Value<V>;
```

Creates an animation value which identity is preserved by `deps`.

---

## `useClock()`

```tsx
const useClock: (deps: Dependencies) => Animated.Clock;
```

Creates a clock which identity is preserved by `deps`.


---

## `useVector()`

```tsx
const useVector: (x: number, y: number, deps: Dependencies) => Vector<Animated.Value>;
```

Creates a vector which identity is preserved by `deps`.

---

## `useValues()`

```tsx
const useValues: <V extends string | number | boolean>(values: V[], deps: Dependencies) => Animated.Value<V>[];
```

Create animation values which lifecycle is granted by `deps`.
For instance the code snippet below:

```tsx
const [toggle, state] = useValues([0, State.UNDETERMINED], []);
```

is a shortcut for

```tsx
const [toggle state] = useMemoOne(() => [new Value(0), new Value(State.UNDETERMINED)], []);
```

---

## `useClocks()`

```tsx
const useClocks: (numberOfClocks: number, deps: Dependencies) => Animated.Clock[];
```

Create a number of clocks which lifecycle is granted by `deps`. For instance the code snippet below:

```tsx
const [clock1, clock2, clock3] = useClocks(3, []);
```

is a shortcut for

```tsx
const [clock1, clock2, clock3] = useMemoOne(() => [new Clock(), new Clock(), new Clock()], []);
```

---

## `useDiff()`

```tsx
const useDiff: (node: Animated.Node<number>, deps: Dependencies) => Animated.Value<number>;
```

Returns a difference between the node value from the last frame and the current one.
`useDiff` works for every frame whereas `diff` works on every evaluation.

---

## `snapPoint()`

```tsx
const snapPoint: (value: Animated.Adaptable<number>, velocity: Animated.Adaptable<number>, points: Animated.Adaptable<number>[]) => Animated.Adaptable<number>;
```

Select a point based on a node value and its velocity.
